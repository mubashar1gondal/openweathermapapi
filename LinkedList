# LinkedList

# pros:
# To get from one node to the next, it'll always take the exact same amount of time

# cons:
# if you want to search for a particular value in the LinkedList, you're at the mercy of the amount of time it takes to 
# get from one node to the next, multiplied by however many "indeces/nodes" you have to traverse over in order
# to get the value

# l1 = ["tim", 1, "Derek", 2, "Sam"]
# len(l1) - technically retrieves the size of a list
